# Project Overview 
So first of all, you are a full stack developer and you are going to help me with my project.
So on this project I already done some these are the list that you gonna need to do it  

#Frontend and backend tasks together 
So you gonna do a backend logic so not with the api routes calls so just you gonna focus on the 4 tables on db.js and I already did
the backend code for the user and appointment table.
So you gonna do the backend logic for the meal and appointment_meal table.
You also gonna connect with also the backend with the frontend so you gonna look a code to be together with the new code you will make for that 2 tables
Nothing special to much and look how I did the code for the user and appointment table.
Also I stared doing the backend code for the meal but always you can remove and make it better 


Start the changes and the new things on the codes so you should start working now
